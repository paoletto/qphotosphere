= QAD photosphere viewer for Qt =

This is an initial implementation of a spherical viewer
for equirectangular pictures, also known as Photo Spheres,
or 360 pictures, in form of a QML element, distributed
through a qml plugin.


== ToDo ==

- fix the missing update issue. Currently worked around with a
  "FpsMeter" hack. calling update() on an item that has content 
  MUST work.

- Fix transformations to play correctly with QtQuick (currently
  (only working fullscreen)

- Use GLUES instead of GLU to render the sphere. Get it to build
  in a decently cross-platform way.

- Fix shaders to be ES2 compliant

- Add a proper gesture area with pinch to zoom. Also, properly
  re-anchor touch points so that panning/zooming follows the fingers.

- Support large images on all platform by blitting only the visible
  part of the image (mipmpa) to the texture and adapting the texture
  matrix appropriately.

- Support photosphere metadata that can be read using TinyEXIF (already
  included and tested) <-- this depends on TinyXML2

- Support proper orientation (bearing) of the image, and prototype
  the combination with QtPositioning

- Redesign the QML API

- Support video sources



== Example usage (currently) ==

import QtQuick 2.7
import QtQuick.Window 2.2
import PhotoSphere 1.0

Window {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480
    title: qsTr("Hello World")

    // Insert your update() hack of choice here, something that pushes redraws

    Rectangle {
        id: container
        anchors.fill: parent
        visible: true
        color: "transparent"

        PhotoSphere {
            id: sphere
            visible: true
            anchors.fill: parent
            imageUrl: "<your photosphere url>" // this initial version supports correctly only full 360 panospheres

            MouseArea {
                id: ma
                anchors.fill: parent
                property var clickedPos;
                property var clickedAzimuth;
                property var clickedElevation;
                property var clickedFoV;
                onPressed: {
                    clickedPos = Qt.point(mouseX, mouseY)
                    clickedAzimuth = sphere.azimuth
                    clickedElevation = sphere.elevation
                }
                onPositionChanged: {
                    var curpos = Qt.point(mouseX, mouseY)
                    var posDiff = Qt.point(curpos.x - ma.clickedPos.x, curpos.y - ma.clickedPos.y)

                    sphere.azimuth = clickedAzimuth + posDiff.x / 6.0
                    sphere.elevation = clickedElevation + posDiff.y / 6.0
                    console.log(sphere.azimuth, sphere.elevation)
                }
                onWheel: {
                    if (wheel.modifiers & Qt.ControlModifier) {
                        sphere.fieldOfView +=  wheel.angleDelta.y / 120;
                        console.log(sphere.fieldOfView)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
